Description: VGA BIOS software for the Bochs and Qemu emulated VGA card
 The goal of this project is to provide a Video BIOS for Bochs and Qemu.
 This VGA BIOS is very specific to the bochs/qemu emulated VGA card.
 It is NOT meant to drive a physical vga card.
 You will probably fry it if you try. You have been warned.
